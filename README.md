## Introduction
SloDB (short for Slovenian video Database) is a dataset useful for testing/evaluating computer vision algorithms. The dataset captures video sequences containing repeatable motion but varying environmental conditions and at varying times of day. This makes it useful for evaluating computer vision algorithms under changeable illumination and weather conditions.

## Details
The dataset is ~116GB and covers a capture period of
