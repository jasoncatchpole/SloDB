# Python Code

## The GUI
Use of the GUI is pretty simple. The first video you load in is the "reference video". As you load in subsequent videos in and seek (using either the seek bar or the next/previous frame buttons) all other videos loaded in will be synchronized so they should show (roughly) the same position/orientation as in the reference video.

## Libraries used
OpenCV, numpy, Pillow.
