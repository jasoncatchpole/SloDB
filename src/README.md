# Language choice

Two versions of the code are available. The code takes in the ground truth files captured alongside the video files and provides a mechanism to synchronize multiple videos so that images from the same position and orientation can easily be extracted from different videos (thus different lighting and environmental conditions). The python version of the code was ported from the C++ version. I recommend you use the python version of the code as it includes a (very) simple GUI and some bug fixes and improvements over the original C++ version. If you are looking for a wonderfully designed graphical user interface demonstrating the best of tkinter then you should keep looking, i'm not known for my GUI prowess. 

The C++ is the original version of the code developed during my PhD. It is kept here for historical reasons but it is recommended you use the Python version of the code.

Push requests are welcome! :)
